# Overview

Welcome to this comprehensive full-stack tutorial where I build and deploy a fully featured AI-powered email client using Next.js 14. The project is developed from the ground up and seamlessly deployed to Vercel. It also includes a subscription feature that allows users to access premium functionality. Payments are handled using Stripe, with webhooks used for event processing.

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary. Useful links.
