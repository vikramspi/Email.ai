# Overview

Welcome to this comprehensive full-stack tutorial where I build and deploy a fully featured AI-powered email client using Next.js 14. The project is developed from the ground up and seamlessly deployed to Vercel. It also includes a subscription feature that allows users to access premium functionality. Payments are handled using Stripe, with webhooks used for event processing.
